• Roughly 57% of total observations accepted coupons.  
• Roughly 41% of bar coupons were accepted.   
• For those who went to a bar 3 or fewer times a month, coupon acceptance was roughly 37%, while for those that visited bars more than three times per month, the coupon acceptance rate was 76% (including those who never go to bars).  
• The acceptance rate among drivers who go to a bar more than once a month and are over the age of 25 is roughly 69%, while this proportion drops to 27% for those who go to a bar less than one time per month.   
• The acceptance rate among drivers who go to bars more than once a month and had passengers that were not a kid and had occupations other than farming, fishing, or forestry is 71%. In comparison, this proportion drops to roughly 31% for those who visit a bar less than once per month (including those who never go to bars).   
• Roughly 71% of coupons are accepted by drivers who go to bars more than once a month, had passengers that were not a kid, and are not widowed.
• Roughly 72% of drivers who visit bars more than once a month and are under the age of 30 accepted the coupon.  
• Roughly 46% of drivers go to restaurants more than 4 times a month at a restaurant with an average expense of less than $20 per person and income is less than 50K accepted the coupon.  
• Single people are the most prone to accept coupons, with 45% of the accepted coupons.  
• Single people between 21- and 26-years old account for 29% of the accepted coupons.  

After reviewing bar coupons, I decided to analyze "Coffee House" coupons.

• Coffee House coupons represent 31.5% of all coupons.  
• Coffee House coupons are the most prevalent, and the level of acceptance is quite balanced (Figure 3).  
• 49.6% of people who received 'Coffee House' coupons accepted them (Figure 4).  
• People between 21 and 31 make up the bulk of those who received a coupon for Coffee House (Figure 5).  
• People between 21 and 31 comprise 63% of those who accepted a Coffee House coupon.  
• The ratio between coupons accepted and not accepted is quite balanced and similar for all ages (Figure 6).  
• Single people and married partner account for 78.6% of those who accepted coupons for Coffee House (Figure 7).  
• Single people between 21 and 26 amount to 25.5%  of those who accepted a Coffee House coupon, followed by people with Married Partner between 26 and 31, which comprise 16% of all those who accepted a Coffee House Coupon (Figure 08).  
• People making between $12,500 and $49,999 comprise 47.8% of all accepted coupons for a coffee house (Figure 09).  
• Single people and people with a married partner, between 21 and 31 make 42% of people who accepted coupons for Coffee House.     
• People in their 20's with income less than $50,000 have a much higher propensity to accept the coupon for a coffee house (Figure 10).  
• In general, men in their 20's have a much higher tendency to accept the coupon for Coffee House than women (Figure 11).  
• Women in their 20s making less than $12,500 and men making more than $100,000 represent the majority of consumers who accepted and used a Coffee House coupon.	

Additional analysis could be performed to understand the influence of companions, education and temperature. Another key aspect could be to understand the impact timing in the acceptance of the coupon.
